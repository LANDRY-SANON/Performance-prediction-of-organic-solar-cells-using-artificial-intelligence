# Performance-prediction-of-organic-solar-cells-using-artificial-intelligence

The current challenge in photovoltaics is to improve the efficiency of cells while reducing their production cost. One of the research avenues is to replace silicon with an organic material. The objective of this project is to use Machine Learning (a subcategory of artificial intelligence) to optimize the organic materials used in order to manufacture organic photovoltaic cells (OPC) with better performance. These OPCs are photovoltaic cells in which at least the active layer is made of organic molecules.

These solar cells are composed mainly of donors and acceptors and the choice of the latter has a direct impact on the performance of the CSO, particularly on its efficiency in converting solar energy into electricity In our study, we limit ourselves to the case of the combinations of type D-A Our steps were first to make an analysis on the Fullerene donor-engine CPO. Then we focused on the Non Fullerene CPOs because they lead to high power conversion efficiencies. And this is our main objective, to design and train a model able to identify probable promising combinations among new combinations.

## Files information

### Data |Folder|

- CEPDB_25000.csv : This CSV file contains data (25000 combinaisons ) on the characteristics of organic solar cell donor candidates obtained from the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database (CEPDB). It is used in our work to analyze the performance prediction of the D-A(Fullerene) CSO. https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/318115
- jjapac4894supp1.csv and jjapac4894supp2.csv : they contain data of approximately 1300 D-A combinations (NF) collected from https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/ac4894 . It was used to construct the correct training data(with smiles and descriptors) .
- Dataset_with_smiles.csv : This file contains data of approximately 1300 D-A combinations (NF) Tandem collected from https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-tvlp7 . It was also used to construct the correct training data .
- jjapac4894supp1 and dataset_with_smiles are used to construct the correct training data saved in the zip file train_data_with_virtualdesciptors.zip . The final test data (for the application phase) is too large ( > 1Gb) to be saved on github. This data can be reproduced by running [this notebook](https://github.com/LANDRY-SANON/Performance-prediction-of-organic-solar-cells-using-artificial-intelligence/blob/main/Data%20Construction/Data%20Construction%20(%20dataset%20with%20smiles%20).ipynb) first and then [this notebook](https://github.com/LANDRY-SANON/Performance-prediction-of-organic-solar-cells-using-artificial-intelligence/blob/main/Data%20Construction/Test%20Data%20Construction%20(%20descriptors%20generation%20).ipynb)  but we can send it directly to you on demand
- dataset_better_pce.csv . we have collected additional data  to enrich our training data for the analysis concerning the combinations D-A(NF) with Jsc,Voc,FF

### Synthesis of articles

Copy of Synthesedesarticles.xlsx . This file summarizes the methods used in some articles we have read in the context of organic solar cell prediction

### Technical Document

All the details of our strategy can be found in this document. We hope that it will help you to better understand our approach

## NB :

The notebook D_A(NFA)_OPV_Prediction.ipynb can be ignored because the use of the variables ( Voc,Jsc,FF ) logically lead to very good performances of our models ( a formula exists linking these variables to PCE )
